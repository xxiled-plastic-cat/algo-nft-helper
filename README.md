# algo-nft-helper
A little NFT helper  - covers, ARC3, ARC19, ARC69 and all the in-between - specifically for retrieving image URLs - not metadata.

Includes code from TxnLab, Rand and Algogator

## Usage
Plug and play - the nfthelper.js and ARC19.js files are required as they talk to each other. And you'll need AlgoSDK.
Note - the "nft" param is an asset returned from an algo indexer call
